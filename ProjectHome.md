# Legend of the Red Python II #

LORP II is a modern multiplayer terminal based game which bears close resemblance to the classic BBS door game LORD II, originally written by Seth Able Robinson. The program is designed to run as a daemon primarily on unix-like systems, which users connect to through telnet in a Unicode enabled terminal of their choice.

Currently, the project only includes code and little game data. This can be obtained from a registered copy of LORD II, or a game world can be assembled using the many available user-made IGMs.
